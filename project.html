            <p>The ability of future generations to meet their own needs is not compromised when current demands are met through sustainable development. The assertion is accurate and offers a goal many people want, but it makes no recommendations or guarantees about gauging progress toward sustainable development. Sustainability is frequently used interchangeably with “sustainable development.” Expansion can be thought of as development. Thus sustainable development involves addressing the issue brought on by ongoing economic growth without posing a threat.</p>
